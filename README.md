# Embedded_C_Programming
A Embedded C Course mainly targeted for absolute beginners to learn microcontroller programming using 'C Programming Language' 


############Related Topics##############
Some of the critical microcontroller-related 'C' concepts such as
1. Importance of bitwise operators
2. Usage of bit manipulation techniques to program MCU peripheral registers
3. accessing memory-mapped registers using pointers
4. pointers and casting
5. structures, bitfields, unions, and bit extraction techniques
6. representing hardware registers details and configuring them using 'C' structure
definitions
7. Usage of const and volatile type qualifiers
8. Interpret complex variable definitions involving the combination of const and
volatile
9. The precise usage of const pointers, const data, volatile const, with pointer and
non-pointer variables
10. The behavior of the code during compiler optimization and solution using volatile
11. Functions and friends
12. Data types, variables definitions, storage class specifiers and much more
13. Loops: while, for, do. while
14. MCU internal architecture and programming peripherals
15. Interfacing projects
All these concepts are discussed with clear examples and writing code for the target embedded
board.
According to 2017 embedded dot com survey still 'C' is one of the most widely used
programming languages for embedded code development
This course gives particular emphasis to learn 'C' programming concepts practically for
microcontroller use cases.

Hardware:
1. You need ARM Cortex M4 based STM32F407 DISCOVERY board from ST if you want to try
out code on the target.
2. Additional interfacing components may be required for interfacing projects
3. You can also be able to follow this course if you have any other boards from ST such as
Nucleo or evaluation.

Software:

1. In this course, Eclipse-based STM32CubeIDE is used as the IDE ( works on
Windows/Linux/Mac) (FREE)
